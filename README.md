### Design patterns

**Strategy Pattern — discount calculation**
`OfferService` holds a `List<DiscountStrategy>` injected by Spring. At booking time every strategy's `isApplicable()` is checked and all matching discounts are **stacked** — both the afternoon and third-ticket discounts can fire together on the same booking. Adding a new offer requires only a new `@Component` class; no existing code changes.

```
DiscountStrategy (interface)
  ├── AfternoonShowDiscountStrategy   — 20% off shows 12:00–16:00
  └── ThirdTicketDiscountStrategy     — 50% off every 3rd ticket (price-desc sort)
```

**Repository Pattern**
All data access is behind `JpaRepository` interfaces with named JPQL queries. Business logic in services never builds queries inline.

**DTO Pattern**
Separate request and response classes for every API surface. Entities never leave the service layer.

## Data model

```
City ──< Theatre ──< Screen ──< Seat
                       │
                      Show >── Movie
                       │
                    Booking ──< BookingSeat >── Seat
                       │
                      User
```

Key entity decisions:

- **Pessimistic write lock** (`PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`) on the seat query inside `BookingService` prevents two concurrent transactions from booking the same seat simultaneously.

---

No Redis required — the current cache type is `simple` (in-memory). Redis configuration is documented in `application.yml` comments for when you are ready to add it.

---

## Getting started

### 1 — Create the MySQL database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE movie_booking CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### 2 — Configure credentials

Edit `src/main/resources/application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/movie_booking?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true
    username: your_username
    password: your_password
```

### 3 — Configure the JWT secret

Replace the default secret with a strong random string of at least 32 characters:

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: your-strong-secret-key-at-least-32-characters
  expiration-ms: 86400000   # 24 hours
```

### 4 — Build and run

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application starts on `http://localhost:8080`.  
On first startup `DataSeeder` runs automatically and populates the database with demo cities, users, theatres, screens, seats, movies, and shows.

### 5 — Swagger UI

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

Use **Authorize** (top right) and paste the JWT token from the login response as `Bearer <token>`.

---

## Demo seed data

`DataSeeder` creates the following on first startup (idempotent — skipped if data exists):

| Type | Details |
|---|---|
| Cities | Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi |
| Users | `customer@example.com`, `partner@example.com`, `admin@example.com` (password: `Password@123`) |
| Theatres | PVR Cinemas — Lower Parel (Mumbai), INOX — Koramangala (Bangalore) |
| Screens | 2 screens per theatre (Screen 1: 100 seats, Screen 2: 80 seats) |
| Seats | Rows A–C → PREMIUM (₹300), Rows D–J → REGULAR (₹200) |
| Movies | The Great Adventure (Hindi/Action), Comedy Nights (Hindi/Comedy), The Silent Thriller (English/Thriller) |
| Shows | Morning (10:00), **Afternoon (14:00)**, Evening (18:00), Night (21:30) — today and tomorrow |

The 14:00 show is in the afternoon window so both discount strategies fire immediately when you test with 3+ seats.

## API reference

### Authentication — `/api/v1/auth`

| Method | Path | Body | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/register` | `{ fullName, email, password, phoneNumber, role }` | Register (role: `CUSTOMER` or `THEATRE_PARTNER`) |
| POST | `/login` | `{ email, password }` | Returns `{ accessToken, tokenType, userId, fullName, role }` |

### Customer — `/api/v1/customer`

All browse endpoints are public. Booking endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method | Path | Query params | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/movies` | `city`, `language`, `genre` (all optional) | Browse active movies |
| GET | `/movies/{movieId}/shows` | `city`, `date` | **Read Scenario 1** — theatres and show timings for a movie in a city on a date |
| GET | `/shows/{showId}/seats` | — | Available seats for a show (seat grid) |
| POST | `/offers/calculate` | `showId`, `seatIds` | **Read Scenario 2** — preview pricing with all applicable discounts |
| POST | `/bookings` | — | **Write Scenario 1** — book tickets (discounts applied automatically) |
| POST | `/bookings/bulk` | — | Bulk book — many seats for one show in one transaction |
| GET | `/bookings` | — | My booking history |
| GET | `/bookings/{reference}` | — | Booking detail by reference number |
| DELETE | `/bookings/{reference}` | — | Cancel a booking |
| DELETE | `/bookings/bulk` | — | Bulk cancel |

**Book tickets request body:**
```json
{
  "showId": 1,
  "selectedSeatIds": [10, 11, 12],
  "promoCode": "optional"
}
```

### Theatre partner — `/api/v1/theatre`

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with role `THEATRE_PARTNER`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/shows` | **Write Scenario 2** — create a show (checks for scheduling conflicts) |
| PUT | `/shows/{showId}` | Update show date, time, or price (blocked if bookings exist) |
| DELETE | `/shows/{showId}` | Cancel a show (blocked if bookings exist) |
| GET | `/shows` | View shows at a theatre on a date (`?theatreId=&date=`) |
| GET | `/shows/{showId}/seats` | View full seat layout and statuses |
| PUT | `/shows/{showId}/seats` | **Write Scenario 3** — bulk update seat status (`?seatIds=&newStatus=BLOCKED`) |
| GET | `/shows/{showId}/bookings` | View all bookings for a show |

**Create show request body:**
```json
{
  "movieId": 1,
  "screenId": 1,
  "showDate": "2024-06-15",
  "showTime": "14:30",
  "baseTicketPrice": 250.00
}
```

## Offer implementation

Both offers are configured in `application.yml` and applied automatically — no promo code required:

```yaml
app:
  offers:
    third-ticket-discount-percent: 50
    afternoon-discount-percent: 20
    afternoon-start-hour: 12
    afternoon-end-hour: 16
```

**Third ticket discount (50% off every 3rd seat)**
Seats are sorted by price descending before applying the discount so the highest-priced 3rd seat always gets discounted.

Example — 5 seats `[₹300, ₹300, ₹300, ₹200, ₹200]` sorted desc:
- Position 3: ₹300 → 50% off = **₹150 discount**
- Position 6: does not exist
- Total discount: ₹150

**Afternoon show discount (20% off total)**
Applies when `showTime >= afternoonStartHour` and `showTime < afternoonEndHour`.

**Stacking**
Both discounts fire independently and are **added together**. A 3-ticket booking at 14:00 gets both:

```
Gross:    ₹900  (3 × ₹300)
3rd seat: −₹150 (50% of ₹300)
Afternoon:−₹180 (20% of ₹900)
Net:      ₹570
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Run all tests (uses H2 in-memory, no MySQL needed)
mvn test

# Run with test profile explicitly
mvn test -Dspring.profiles.active=test
```

`BookingWorkflowTest` covers five scenarios against `GET /api/v1/customer/movies` using `@MockBean MovieRepository` and `@WithMockUser`, running entirely in-memory.
